                    <h3>Course vision</h3>
                    <p>There are three ways to approach the domain - research, technical, or industry.</p>
                    <p>As a practitioner in the space I tend to approach the domain from an industry perspective with a technical slant.</p>
                    <p>In my previous master courses I had more flexibilty to curate online guest lectures in the evening, but this is more diffcult at SIT.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Theory and code</h3>
                    <p>The course material is split up into two components &mdash; <b>theory</b> and <b>code</b>.</p>
                    <p>In the <b>theory</b> portion, we will go through the research paired with lots of real-life case examples.</p>
                    <p>In the <b>code</b> portion, we will be building interactive data visualizations for the web.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>On technology</h3>
                    <p>Visualizations can be built with all kinds of software tool / cloud-based platforms.</p>
                    <p>However, for an interactive visualization course I will going through how to do it natively for the web.</p>
                    <p>We'll be using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3 (Data Driven Documents)</a>, the defacto data visualization library for the web.</p>
                </section> 

                <section>
                    <h3>Why D3</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If you're interested in analytics, Excel / Tableau / PowerBI are good non-coding choices.</li>
                    <li>If you're familiar with data science languages, Python or R has graphing libraries (ggplot2, plotly, mathlibplot, etc.)</li>
                    <li>D3 is used because you want to <b>build beautiful interactive visualizations</b> for the web. You can go really deep to get the interactions you want.</li>
                    <li>It also has comprehensive built-in <b>design patterns for visualizations</b>, like geo projections, force simulations, hierarchies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, it is open source and free.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>How to build for web</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>For web visualization there are many libraries / tools / platforms beyond D3.</li>
                    <li>If you are pressed for time for a standard chart type, it might be easier to use other tools / libraries <a href="https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-d3">built on top of D3</a>.</li>
                    <li>You can also use other libraries (leaflet, highcharts, etc.) to build the components you need.</li>
                    <li>There are even full platforms - Mapbox, Cesium, etc. that will allow you to host and build on top of those platforms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations</h3>
                    <p>Some web development is a technical requirement for this course. It is expected that you know <b>HTML / CSS / JS</b>.</p>
                    <p>I might run through some recap refreshers, but it will be quick.</p>
                    <p>If you are weak in this area you will have to do your own reading and self-revision.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">By now you should know how to write some web stuff. There are tons of tutorials on the web.</p>
                    <p class="smallfont">If you want to use more complicated frameworks / architectures to build your visualizations, please do go ahead. But it is not neccessary.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations 2</h3>
                    <p>On the JS side, you should also know how to pull data from APIs (AJAX), data formats like JSON (GeoJSON, TopoJSON).</p>
                    <p>Beyond HTML / CSS / JS, we will also be using <b>Git</b>, a modern version control tool.</p>
                    <p>Students will be publishing their assignments and work on <b>GitHub</b> and <b>GitPages</b>.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">If you do not have a GitHub account, please do sign up for one. You should have one by now.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations 3</h3>
                    <p>I will go through some lab sessions in D3, and a smattering of geospatial tools like Leaflet.</p>
                    <p>However, if you prefer to use other web-based tools for the final project, you are free to do so.</p>
                    <p>The only requirement is that you must publish your work on a GitHub repository (through GitPages).</p>
                    <p>For coordination for this module, we will be using communication tool <b>Slack</b>.</p>

                        <p><i>Sonification</i> has never taken off, as sound is not good at providing overviews of large information spaces compared with vision. We think of sound as sequential.</p>
                        <p>Taste, smell, and haptic touch are even more limited in terms of communicating abstract information.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>The bigger and more complex the dataset, the harder it is to show it all at once given the limitations of both people and display.</p>
                        <p>Computer systems allow us new viz idioms by allowing interaction, changing the view when an action (search, filter, etc.) is taken.</p>
                        <p>Interactivity often is key to being able to visualize complex datasets &mdash; from high level overviews to nitty gritty data details &mdash; allowing users to go up and down the <a href="https://www.toolshero.com/communication-skills/ladder-of-abstraction/" targt="_blank">ladder of abstraction</a> easily.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Although there are just a few standard charts that we as humans are familiar with (e.g. bar, line, pie, scatterplot, etc.), you can combine basic chart types (especially with interaction) and make complex viz idioms.</p>
                        <p>Like music with the same basic 12 tones, or writing with the same grammar and vocabulary, by combining the basics, you can produce complex data visualizations.</p>

                        <p>Because <b>why</b> the user is interacting with the data is important.</p>
                        <p>Visualizations for exploratory analysis vs for presentation / enjoyment is vastly different.</p>
                        <p>Are you creating a visualization that is a once-off (to get an idea of the data), putting together a nice presentation to explain insights, or building a tool to automate this process?</p>

                        <p>Because we should measure how effective the visualization is in supporting user tasks.</p>
                        <p>If you're doing storytelling, the story should be measured on how effective it was as a communication channel.</p>
                        <p>If you're doing exploratory analysis, what insights have you gained to help aid whatever model you're doing?</p>

                        <p>I feel Tamara's position here is a little pedantic, but I understand her point of view.</p>
                        <p>Because there are so many ways to mash-up data and viz idioms, the likelihood you'll get a bad design far outstrips a good one.</p>
                        <p>Like in the music analogy, you can randomly throw notes together, but it most likely won't make a good song.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Tamara's argument is that there could be many ways to ask if the visualization has met your user's needs.</p>
                        <p>Whilst labels like <i>effective communication</i> and <i>insight engagement</i> are not hard science, I believe that this can still be measured (via surveys).</p>
                        <p>A good user-centric experience design process can help with validating some of these issues. We'll look into this in later parts of the course.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Of course there are resource limitations. Tamara states three: Human perceptual / cognitive capacity, computational capacity and display capacity.</p>
                        <p>Interaction helps solve some of the perceptual / cognitive load, but we're still vulnerable to human quirks like <b>change blindness</b>.</p>
                        <p>On the technical front, we will be going through some of the limitations of drawing for the web later in the course.</p>
